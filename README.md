# Advent of Code 2023

For the third year in a row, I am going to use Advent of Code as a way to learn a new programming language. This year is Haskell!

Previously, I did [2021 in Go](https://github.com/emilioziniades/advent-of-code-2021) and [2022 in Rust](https://github.com/emilioziniades/advent-of-code-2022).
